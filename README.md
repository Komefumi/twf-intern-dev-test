# TWF Intern Dev Test

This is the code repository for a front-end test/assignment I had been given as part of my application to become an intern.

With the lack of time owing to having managed to be considered for a few applications at roughly the same time, I ended up with not much time left before the time for submission. And so this application follows the specifications and is scaffolded quickly using ReactStrap (A library that provides React bindings for Bootstrap).

The code isn't completely DRY in principle, but I've tried to keep it fairly straightforward.

The application interfaces with Google's Firebase API and makes use of it to provide registration and backend storage.

The application may be considered a 'proof of concept'. A barebones, limited application.
